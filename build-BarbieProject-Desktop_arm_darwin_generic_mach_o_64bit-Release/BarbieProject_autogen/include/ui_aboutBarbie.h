                        "ant and long-lasting creation, Barbie, arrived. She was the brainchild of Ruth Handler.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">According to one of two origin stories, Handler noticed her daughter Barbara playing with paper dolls and decided she wanted to give her a doll that was a woman she could aspire to. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Barbie, named after her daughter, was born and she premiered at the annual Toy Fair in New York in March 1959. In the first year, 300,000 Barbie dolls were sold.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">She was \342\200\230petite\342\200\231 as the advert chimes, with all the latest clothes and accessories. Among these was, of course, a wedding dress. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Her immediate MO was clearly as a stylish and sophisticated style maven, the kind of svelte, pretty woman young girls wanted to be \342\200\223 at least in 1959. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-fami"
                        "ly:'Helvetica Neue';\">Her first ever outfit \342\200\223 as exemplified in Gerwig\342\200\231s initial teaser trailer for the Barbie movie \342\200\223 was a black and white swimsuit, with white heels and sunglasses. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Unsurprisingly, by 1961, she was \342\200\230going steady\342\200\231 with Ken (oddly named after the Handlers\342\200\231 son).</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue'; font-weight:700; color:#f35de2;\">Courting controversy</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">By the 1960s, Barbie was already attracting criticism for being a \342\200\230sex symbol\342\200\231. To counteract this, the Handlers gave her a little sister, Skipper, and a best friend, Midge \342\200\223 who would go to have her own chequered history. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Fashioned as a \342\200\230homelier\342\200\231 friend for Barbie Midge would disappear after 1967, returning in the 1980s alon"
                        "g with a husband, kids and a \342\200\230Happy Family Line\342\200\231 of toys, which even included Pregnant Midge. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">The line courted scandal from every angle \342\200\223 among which was outrage that Midge was pregnant without a wedding ring. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Though to many Barbie was too conventional \342\200\223 with her improbable proportions and origins as a doll who aspires to, essentially, marry Ken \342\200\223 to many she was too progressive. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Indeed, as early as 1968, nine years after Barbie\342\200\231s invention, Mattel introduced their first Black doll.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Christie arrived at a fecund point in American politics, just as the Civil Rights Act of 1968 \342\200\223 enshrining the illegality of radical discrimination\342\200\223 was passed.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helv"

She was designed by Kitty Perkins</span><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/barbie-kitty-black-perkins-designer-diversity-mattel-dolls-2023-4#in-1979-black-perkins-who-had-become-barbies-principal-designer-the-year-before-was-tasked-with-creating-an-outfit-for-the-first-ever-black-barbie-shes-black-shes-beautiful-shes-dynamite-the-dolls-box-said-6\"><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue'; text-decoration: underline; color:#094fd1;\">,</span></a><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\"> who was then chief designer for Barbie.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">She bought her first Barbie doll aged 28, when interviewing for the position, when she was asked to create a whole new wardrobe for the doll. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">She was chief designer for more than 30 years and, in 1979, she was asked to design the first ever Black Barbie. </span>"
                        "</p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">When she arrived, she was wearing a red disco jumpsuit and came with the tagline: &quot;She's Black! She's beautiful! She's dynamite!\342\200\235</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue'; font-weight:700; color:#f35de2;\">Barbie and feminism</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">If many were concerned that Barbie was too \342\200\230sexy,\342\200\231 there were true concerns amongst the feminist movement \342\200\223 which took on a whole new momentum in the 1960s and 1970s \342\200\223 that Barbie was an anti-feminist role model; </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">a doll created (especially if we consider the alternative origin story) as a male, not a female, fantasy. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Quickly, Barbie had become a shorthand for bimbo, for a sort of man-pleasing vapidity that Second Wave feminists took issue with. Indeed, at a 1970 Women\342\200\231s S"
                        "trike for Equality march in New York, the chant became \342\200\234I am not a Barbie doll\342\200\235.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Yet Barbie was already a working woman. Just one year after her inception she was working as a fashion designer and the following year she took on three more jobs: an air stewardess, a nurse and a balerina.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Throughout her first decade, Barbie would take on myriad vocations; from tennis player to astronaut to the vaguely coverall job of \342\200\230career girl\342\200\231.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">While her earliest tasks were more stereotypically \342\200\230feminine,\342\200\231 by 1973, she was a surgeon, and in 1991, she joined the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. By 1992.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">\342\200\230Business Executive Barbie\342\200\231 had snagged herself a corner office and that same year, she made her f"
                        "irst bid for President. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Fun fact: Barbie has run for president every election since. She has also, since 1959, held more than 250 careers \342\200\223 from dentist to Olympic skier. Busy girl.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">In her 1994 memoir, Ruth Handler said: \342\200\234My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.\342\200\235</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue'; font-weight:700; color:#f35de2;\">Barbie and body image</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">If there is one unswerving commentary about Barbie, it is the unrealistic proportions of her figure. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Impossibly nipped-in waist, generous boobs and unbendable legs which, famously, would never be able to support Barbie\342\200\231s frame in re"
                        "ality. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Beyond the fact that she is ludicrously appointed, it is the message this sends to young girls that has always caused concern. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">How impossible would it be to look like Barbie, and, equally, how depressing when you look nothing like her.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Indeed, the doll has historically propagated an unrealistic body type, and worrying messages. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">A 1963 Barbie came complete with a diet book that simply read \342\200\230Don\342\200\231t eat\342\200\231. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">In 2006, a study published in the journal of Developmental Psychology concluded that girls exposed to Barbie at a young age were more vocal about being thin, compared with those exposed to other dolls.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Evelyn Mazzocc"

She wanted to see why it was that the world\342\200\231s most loved and hated doll drew such derision. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">The most common responses were \342\200\230out of touch,\342\200\231 \342\200\230materialistic\342\200\231 and \342\200\230not diverse\342\200\231. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">She told that year that she regularly received hate mail, and even death threats, about Barbie\342\200\231s body. </span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">Then, in 2016, three new body shapes were introduced to Barbie: petite, tall and curvy.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue';\">In April of this year, Mattel released its first ever Barbie with Down Syndrome.</span></p><p><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica Neue'; font-weight:700; color:#f35de2;\">The legacy of Barbie</span></p><"
